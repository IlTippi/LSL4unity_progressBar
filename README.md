# Unity Progress Bar Example

This is an example of a 3D progress bar UI in Unity, which is controlled based on LSL data (or any input). It's part of a VR game where the progress bar shows the player's concentration level, energy, or any other value.

## Features:
- Simple Unity script to update the progress bar in real time
- Example of using Unity UI (Slider) and updating the value dynamically

## How to use:
1. Import the Unity project into your IDE.
2. Connect the appropriate input (e.g., from LSL or another source).
3. Play the scene and the progress bar will update based on the data.
